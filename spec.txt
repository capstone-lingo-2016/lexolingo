Special Requirements
--------------------

1) flashcards should have images and audio: 
    Anki supports pictures and audio and deck editing by student
    see: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1217051330
    Use their format
2) A confuser feature - 
    Instructor can create the cards with alternate pronounciation or text, so the english will be the same,
    but the foreign text will have variations
3) Dictionary -
    Can we use an online dictionary?
    Found some free ones for download - http://www.freelang.net/dictionary/japanese.php
