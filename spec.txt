Special Requirements
--------------------

1) flashcards should have images and audio: 
    Anki supports pictures and audio and deck editing by student
    see: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1217051330
    Use their format
2) A confuser feature - 
    Instructor can create the cards with alternate pronounciation or text, so the english will be the same,
    but the foreign text will have variations.
    LingoLearn uses fixed lists of alternate Kanji
3) Dictionary -

    Found some free ones for download - http://www.freelang.net/dictionary/japanese.php
