Special Requirements
--------------------

1) flashcards should have images and audio: 
    Anki supports pictures and audio and deck editing by student
    see: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1217051330
    Use their format
2) A confuser feature - 
    Instructor can create the cards with alternate pronounciation or text, so the english will be the same,
    but the foreign text will have variations.
    LingoLearn uses fixed lists of alternate Kanji
3) Dictionary -
    Can we use an online dictionary?
    Found some free ones for download - http://www.freelang.net/dictionary/japanese.php
    Xenogloss has 2 downloaded.

    (Should there be practice quizzes - scored not saved, where students can block one field in the flashcard data)
    (This is where the spaced repetition comes in)
    (In Duolingo and similar apps, user takes an easy quiz to learn the words, user cannot view decks)
